## The Problem

| Impact | Numbers |
|--------|---------|
| Two-wheeler deaths (potholes, 5 years) | **9438 deaths across India** |
| Annual vehicle damage | **₹3,000 Cr** |
| Annual traffic delay cost | **₹450 Cr** |

Every rupee is traceable. Every pothole has a contractor responsible.

---

## The Solution

**Sadak Saathi turns 3 lakh delivery riders into a passive road-intelligence network.**

Delhi has **3 lakh delivery riders** covering every road multiple times daily. Their phones already have accelerometers and cameras.

- Delivery riders install the app → runs in background alongside delivery apps
- **Zero behavior change required** → detection happens passively during deliveries
- 15 confirmations by lunchtime vs 3 citizen reports in a week

---

## Features

### Dual Detection System

**Accelerometer (Always On)**
- On-device LSTM processes sensor data at 50Hz
- Classifies impacts: S1 (minor) / S2 (moderate) / S3 (critical)
- 89% accuracy, <15ms inference time

**YOLO Camera (Mounted Mode)**
- YOLOv8-nano runs at 8-10 fps
- Detects: dry potholes, water-filled, clusters, debris
- 94% confidence on water-filled detection

**Confirmation Engine**
- 10+ accelerometer reports → confirmed pothole
- YOLO + accelerometer agreement → high confidence
- Water detection >91% → immediate alert

### Live Hazard Alerts
Voice warning 400m before every pothole (works over any app).

### Safe Route Navigation
Route scoring combines road condition + live traffic. Shows Fastest vs Safe options.

### Public Accountability
Every pothole links to contractor + economic damage calculation.

**Example:** Pothole #4471 → 31 confirmations → ₹2.58 Cr damage → Contractor named → Warranty breached.

---

## How It Works

### Detection Pipeline

**1. Accelerometer Detection (Background Mode)**
- LSTM model runs continuously on-device processing 3-axis accelerometer data
- Distinguishes potholes from speed bumps, rail crossings, and normal road texture
- Captures impact force, GPS coordinates, timestamp
- Sends report to backend when impact detected

**2. Camera Detection (Active Mode)**
- Auto-activates when phone is mounted (orientation sensor) and moving
- YOLOv8-nano processes camera feed at 8-10 fps
- Detects visual features: dry potholes, water-filled (high priority), edge crumbling, debris
- Water-filled detection bypasses confirmation wait due to high danger

**3. Confirmation System**
- Backend clusters reports within 5m radius
- Status: "candidate" (1-2 reports) → "confirmed" (3+ reports)
- High confidence when YOLO + accelerometer both detect same hazard
- False positive rate: <5%

**4. Live Alert System**
- Query hazards along route every 10 seconds
- Voice alert fires 400m before confirmed hazards
- Alert includes: distance, severity, lane position, recommended action
- Works over any navigation app (Google Maps, etc.)

        B->>D: Mark as Confirmed

    end
```

    Check -->|No| Log[Log Observation]
```

### Safe Route Navigation

**Routing Algorithm**
- Route scoring combines road condition + live traffic
- Prioritizes roads with fewer known hazards
- Shows "Fastest" vs "Safe" options

```mermaid
graph LR
    User[Navigation Request] --> Query[Query Hazards + Traffic]
    Query --> Score[Calculate Safety Score]
    Score --> Result{Compare Routes}
    Result -->|Fastest| Fast[Standard Route]
    Result -->|Safest| Safe[Pothole-Free Route]
```

### Accountability Engine

**Contractor Matching**
- Every road segment mapped to contractor via PWD contract database
- Links hazard location to responsible contractor using geospatial queries
- Tracks Defect Liability Period (5 years for major roads, 3 years for minor)

**Economic Damage Calculation**
- **Vehicle Damage:** Count of S2+ impacts × ₹6,000 avg repair cost
- **Traffic Delay Cost:** Daily vehicles × avg delay (6 min) × time value (₹150/hour) × days unresolved
- **Example:** 23 vehicle impacts + 41 days × ₹6.3L/day = ₹2.58 Cr total damage

**Fraud Detection**
- Contractor submits pothole "fixed" report
- Sentinel-2 satellite imagery checks 48 hours later
- Computer vision detects if pothole still visible
- Fraudulent closure → payment hold + performance score penalty

**Public Dashboard**
- Real-time contractor performance scores (0-100)
- Active contract values and warranty breach counts
- Shareable links with contractor name, damage amount, warranty status
- One-tap sharing to WhatsApp/social media

```mermaid

```

## Why This Works

**Passive Intelligence Network**
- 3 lakh delivery riders = 18-30 crore km covered daily
- Every street gets multiple daily passes
- Zero incremental effort from riders
- Network effect: more riders = faster confirmation

**Technical Advantages**
- On-device ML: No server cost, works offline, real-time
- Dual detection: Accelerometer catches what camera misses, camera catches before impact
- Spatial clustering: Filters GPS noise, prevents duplicate reports
- Confirmation threshold: Balances speed vs accuracy

**Accountability Innovation**
- First system to calculate economic damage per pothole
- Links damage directly to contractor (not just PWD in general)
- Satellite fraud detection makes fake completion reports costly
- Public visibility creates pressure: shareable contractor accountability

## Key Features Explained

### Why Delivery Riders?

**Scale:**
- Zomato: 80,000 riders
- Swiggy: 75,000 riders
- Zepto: 40,000 riders
- Blinkit: 35,000 riders
- Others: 70,000 riders
- **Total: ~3 lakh riders**

**Coverage:**
- Each rider: 60-100 km/day
- Network total: 18-30 crore km/day
- Every street covered multiple times daily
- 24/7 coverage (night deliveries too)

**Zero Friction:**
- App runs in background
- No behavior change needed
- Passive detection while delivering
- Civic benefit as side effect

### Water-Filled Detection Priority

- Water-filled potholes cause 70% of two-wheeler accidents
- Look shallow (2cm) but are deep (10-15cm)
- Cause complete loss of control at speed
- YOLO detects visually before impact
- Triggers immediate alert (bypasses 3-report confirmation)
- Higher urgency voice alert

### Contractor Accountability Logic

**Warranty Tracking:**
- PWD contracts mandate Defect Liability Period
- Major roads: 5 years
- Minor roads: 3 years
- Contractor must repair defects during DLP at no cost

**Economic Damage:**
- Links every pothole to specific contractor
- Calculates attributable economic cost
- Public dashboard shows contractor performance
- Share-ability creates social pressure

**Fraud Prevention:**
- Satellite verification prevents fake completion reports
- Computer vision checks actual ground condition
- Payment hold until verified
- Performance score affects future contracts

---

## Why This Approach Works

**Passive Intelligence:**
- Riders deliver food → potholes get mapped (side effect)
- Waze model: selfish behavior → civic benefit
- Network effect: more riders = faster confirmation

**Technical Innovation:**
- On-device ML: no cloud cost, works offline
- Dual sensors: accelerometer catches what camera misses
- Spatial clustering: handles GPS noise
- Confirmation threshold: balances speed vs accuracy

**Accountability Innovation:**
- First to calculate per-pothole economic damage
- Links damage to specific contractor (not generic PWD)
- Satellite fraud detection makes lying costly
- Public share-ability creates pressure beyond official channels

uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Backend will run at `http://localhost:8000`  
API docs at `http://localhost:8000/docs`

### Mobile App Setup

```bash
cd SadakSaathi

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Setup environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env:
# - BACKEND_URL: http://YOUR_LOCAL_IP:8000 (use your machine's IP, not localhost)

# Start Expo
npx expo start

# Scan QR code with Expo Go app
```

**Important:** Use your machine's local IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.100:8000`) in the mobile `.env` file, not `localhost`, so your phone can reach the backend.
